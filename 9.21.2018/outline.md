### Zube - Project Management APP

Projects - the highest level containers in Zube. You attach one or more GitHub Repositories to it.

- A project also allows you to control which team members have access to your data. Only your team members have access to your data. Only your team members have access to your data. Only your team members that are project users will be able to view the components of a Project. Project admins can add or remove project users to make other users a project admin. A list of your Projects can be found on the Zube homepage, after you sign in. If you do not currently belong to any Projects, there will be a form that allows you to create your first project.

- Once you submit your new Project, Zube will automatically import the issues from the source repositories, turn those issue into Zube cards and generate a Workspace for your Project. Once the import is finished, you'll be redirected to your Workspace.

Workspaces - contains: Kanban board, Sprint board, Sprints, and Analytics.

What is Sprint -
An Agile sprint is a set duration of development time in which work is to be completed.

Sprint Board - The columns on the left side of the sprint board are tasks that are not currently part of any sprint. They are a slightly dark color and are outside of the sprint section. The sprint section is comprised of the colums beneath the sprint header information, and are slightly lighter in color than the global colums. By default the first sprint column is called "Ready". To add a card to a sprint, simply drag it into any of the columns in the sprint section. Typically, to add a card to a sprint, you would drag a card from the Backlog, which is a global column intended to be used as your product backlog, to the Ready column, which is sprint column and is supposed to be used as your sprint backlog.<br>

#### Analytics

##### Burndown charts

Burndowns allow you to see how much work your team has left to do in the Sprint and if your team is on schedule to complete all the Sprint work on time. <br>
The Burndown chart has two lines. The Open Points line show how many open points are left in your Sprint by day.
The Ideal Open Points line shows how much work should still be open in order to complete the work in the Sprint on time.

##### Burnup charts

##### Throughput chart

##### Users Throughput chart

##### Velocity Chart

If you are using Sprints, you can track how much work your team is getting done per sprint with the Velocity chart. The Velocity chart is a stacked bar chart showing how many cards or points were closed during each sprint in the selected date range. Each section of the bars represents one of your sources. The Velocity chart allows you to see potential problems in your team's efficiency as well as providing a way to predict how much work your team will be able to accomplish in future sprints.
The Velocity chart can be filtered by source and label. You can also adjust the date range dispalyed. Data can be presented as pint toals or card totals.

#### Issue Manager

### Codetree

- Manage issues from different repos in the same view
- [issue dependency](https://docs.codetree.com/article/8-dependencies)
- Powerful keyboard shortcuts, including a Slack-esque issue switcher
